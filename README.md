<h1>Hello and welcome to the game: Red Light!</h1>

This is a text based game. The premise of it is to escape the room that you have been locked in. 

**Everything has to be typed in correctly as this is not programmed to pick up misspelled words and is sometimes case sensitive. I highly recommended typing in lower case and avoid using spaces. For example, if you wanted to access the nightstand, just type in "nightstand". If not typed in correctly, you will still be brought to the main menu**

There are 5 places you can go in the room: _bed, nightstand, bookshelf, closet, and the door._ From these, you can interact with a _stuffed animal, a picture, a journal, a newspaper, a candle, a book, a costume, and two keys._ You can also access your _inventory._

There is dialogue between you and the person who is keeping you in the room. Everything in quotation marks is from the person holding you in the room. 

Everytime you touch an object, you are flashed with a memory from it.

_TW: Mentions of suicide, tr*fficking ring and killing. Contains foul language._
